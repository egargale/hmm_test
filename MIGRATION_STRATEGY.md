## Implementation Methodology

### Test-Driven Development Approach

**1. Test Before Implementation**
```python
# Example: Testing enhanced feature engineering
def test_enhanced_feature_engineering():
    # Given
    config = FeatureConfig(indicators=['atr', 'rsi', 'bb'])
    engineer = FeatureEngineer(config)
    data = load_test_data()

    # When
    result = engineer.add_features(data)

    # Then
    assert 'atr' in result.columns
    assert 'rsi' in result.columns
    assert 'bb_width' in result.columns
    assert len(result) == len(data) - expected_nan_rows
```

**2. Migration Validation Tests**
```python
def test_migration_parity():
    # Test that migrated functionality produces same results as original
    original_result = main.add_features(test_data)
    migrated_result = enhanced_engineer.add_features(test_data)

    assert_results_equal(original_result, migrated_result)
```

### Incremental Integration Strategy

**1. Feature Flags for Gradual Rollout**
```python
# Configuration-based feature enabling
class MigrationConfig:
    use_enhanced_features: bool = False
    use_new_processing_engines: bool = False
    use_advanced_visualization: bool = False

def process_data(data: pd.DataFrame, config: MigrationConfig):
    if config.use_enhanced_features:
        return enhanced_feature_engineering(data)
    else:
        return original_feature_engineering(data)
```

**2. Parallel Implementation During Transition**
```python
# Run both implementations in parallel during testing
def validate_migration(data: pd.DataFrame):
    original_result = original_pipeline(data)
    migrated_result = migrated_pipeline(data)

    # Compare results
    differences = compare_results(original_result, migrated_result)
    assert differences < tolerance_threshold
```

### Performance Monitoring

**1. Benchmarking Framework**
```python
class PerformanceBenchmark:
    def benchmark_processing_speed(self, data_sizes: List[int]) -> BenchmarkResult:
        # Compare processing speeds across data sizes

    def benchmark_memory_usage(self, data_sizes: List[int]) -> MemoryBenchmark:
        # Compare memory usage across implementations
```

**2. Continuous Performance Monitoring**
```python
class PerformanceMonitor:
    def track_operation_performance(self, operation_name: str, operation_func):
        with self.performance_tracker.track(operation_name):
            result = operation_func()
