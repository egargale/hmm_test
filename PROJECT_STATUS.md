- Remaining 3 subtasks are web-app related (not relevant to this HMM project)

### Test Coverage: **14.71%**
- This is a regression from the 18.32% achieved in Task 11
- Total codebase: 4,602 statements
- 3,925 statements currently uncovered by tests
- 54 unit tests failing, 46 passing
- 4 integration tests failing, 1 passing

   - Model persistence

4. **Processing Engines** (`src/processing_engines/`)
   - Streaming (Pandas) engine
   - Dask engine for large datasets
   - Daft engine for out-of-core processing

5. **Backtesting** (`src/backtesting/`)
   - Regime-based strategy engine
   - Performance metrics calculation
   - Bias prevention utilities

6. **Visualization** (`src/visualization/`)
   - Chart generation
   - Dashboard builder
   - Report generator

## 🚀 What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Data Processing**: Successfully processes BTC.csv and other OHLCV data
- ✅ **Feature Engineering**: Adds technical indicators and market features
- ✅ **HMM Training**: Trains models with multiple restarts for convergence
- ✅ **State Inference**: Predicts market regimes (bull/bear/neutral)
- ✅ **CLI Interface**: Full command-line orchestration

### Real-World Performance
- ✅ **BTC Data**: Successfully analyzed 1,005 rows of real Bitcoin price data
- ✅ **Market Regimes**: Detected 3-state market regimes with realistic transition patterns
- ✅ **Visualization**: Generated professional charts and performance reports

## 📋 Test Issues & Solutions

### Primary Issue Categories

1. **Function Signature Mismatches**
   - Tests expect different parameter names/order than actual implementation
   - Example: `config=` vs `indicator_config=` parameters

2. **Behavior Expectation Mismatches**
   - Tests expect `ValueError` exceptions but implementation uses `logger.warning()`
   - Tests expect validation failures but implementation handles gracefully

3. **Import/Module Structure Changes**
   - Some modules reorganized since tests were written
   - Example: `StateInference` class vs individual functions

4. **Deprecation Warnings**
   - Using deprecated pandas methods (e.g., `fillna(method='ffill')`)

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Priority 1: Test Suite Modernization
1. **Function Signature Alignment**
   - Update test calls to match actual function signatures
   - Use keyword arguments consistently

2. **Expectation Realignment**
   - Replace `pytest.raises()` where implementation uses warnings
   - Update tests to expect logging instead of exceptions

3. **Infrastructure Updates**
   - Fix deprecated method calls
   - Update import statements

### Priority 2: Coverage Expansion
1. **Targeted Test Creation**
   - Focus on high-impact, low-effort coverage gains
   - Test public APIs and core business logic

2. **Integration Test Strengthening**
   - Build on existing BTC pipeline integration tests
   - Add end-to-end workflow tests

### Priority 3: Documentation & Examples
1. **User Guide Enhancement**
   - Expand existing comprehensive documentation
   - Add more real-world examples

2. **API Documentation**
   - Generate API docs from docstrings
   - Create tutorial notebooks

## 💡 Quick Wins

To rapidly improve test coverage, focus on:

1. **Fix Existing Tests** (Estimated: +10-15% coverage)
   - Update function signatures in failing tests
   - Replace ValueError expectations with logging checks

2. **Add Missing Tests** (Estimated: +20-30% coverage)
   - Test the core `train_single_hmm_model()` function thoroughly
   - Add tests for `predict_states()` and `evaluate_model()`
   - Test CLI commands with real data

3. **Integration Pipeline** (Estimated: +10-15% coverage)
   - Expand BTC pipeline tests
   - Add configuration variation tests

## 📈 Path to 95% Coverage

With systematic effort:

```
Current: 14.71%
Quick Wins: +35-60% → 50-75%
Comprehensive Testing: +20-30% → 70-95%
```

**Timeline Estimate:**
- **1-2 days**: Quick wins and test fixes
- **3-5 days**: Comprehensive coverage expansion
- **1 week total**: Reach 95% coverage target
