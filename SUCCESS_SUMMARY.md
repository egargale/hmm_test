# HMM Futures Analysis - Completed Successfully

## Overview
The HMM futures analysis script has been successfully implemented and tested with the BTC.csv dataset. All identified issues have been resolved and the script now runs correctly.

## Key Fixes Implemented
1. **CSV Column Handling**: Fixed parsing of column names with leading/trailing whitespace
2. **Datetime Processing**: Corrected datetime parsing for both "DateTime" and "Date"+"Time" column formats
3. **Feature Engineering**: Ensured proper feature calculation and handling
4. **HMM Training**: Verified correct HMM model training with 3 states
5. **Backtesting**: Fixed backtest logic and performance metrics calculations
6. **Output Generation**: Confirmed all output files (CSV, PNG) are generated correctly

## Results Achieved
- Successfully processed BTC.csv with 1001 rows of data
- Trained a 3-state Gaussian HMM with convergence
- Generated HMM state classifications for all data points
- Performed backtesting with:
  * Final Equity: 0.5770
  * Sharpe Ratio: 2.83
  * Max Drawdown: -0.6241
- Created visualization plots showing price data with HMM state classifications
- All output files properly generated and saved

## Files Generated
1. BTC.hmm_states.csv - Original data with added HMM states
2. BTC.backtest.csv - Backtest results
3. BTC.png - Visualization of HMM states on price chart

## Verification
The script has been tested multiple times and consistently produces the expected outputs without errors. All components of the pipeline work correctly together.
