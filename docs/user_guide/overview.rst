Overview
========

The HMM Futures Analysis system is a sophisticated toolkit for applying Hidden Markov Models to futures market analysis. This document provides a high-level overview of the system's architecture and capabilities.

What is HMM Futures Analysis?
-----------------------------------

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are statistical models that excel at identifying underlying states or regimes in time series data. In futures markets, these states might represent:

* **Trending Markets**: Persistent upward or downward price movements
* **Ranging Markets**: Sideways price action within defined boundaries
* **Volatile Regimes**: Periods of high volatility and uncertainty
* **Mean Reversion**: Markets that tend to return to average levels

Our system automates the entire process from data preparation through regime identification and backtesting.

System Architecture
------------------

The HMM Futures Analysis system consists of several key components:
